# Observations and insights of coupon acceptance data

# Bar coupon acceptance:

- the overall acceptance of the bar coupon is 41%. However, drivers who go to bars more often in general, they tend to accept coupons at a higher rate. For example, the acceptance rate of drivers who go to bars more than once a month is 69%; those who go four or more times a month is 77%.

- Drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 have an acceptance rate of 69.5%. Since the acceptance rate of all drivers who go to bars more than once a month is 69%, drivers under the age of 25 have a similar acceptance rate in this category.

- Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month with income less than 50K have bar coupon acceptance rate of 45%. It is slightly higher than the overall acceptance of the bar coupon at 41%, however, I would not consider them as the target audience, since they would not increase the overall acceptance rate significantly.


# Coffee House coupon acceptance:

- The overall acceptance rate of the Coffee House coupon is 50%. Drivers with a passenger(s) had a higher acceptance rate of 59%, compared to those who drive along at 44%. This is an interesting observation because one coupon potentially brings multiple customers into the Coffee House when the driver has a passenger(s).

- Drivers with no passengers who received a coupon to a Coffee House at 10am have an acceptance rate of 61%, which is considerably higher than overall drivers with no passengers at 44%. Therefore, the timing of the coupon distribution has a high impact on the acceptance rate.

- One of the highest acceptance rates of 74% had drivers who go to Coffee House four or more times a month, had no urgent destination place, and when the temperature was above 60 degrees. While the destination urgency of the driver might be unknown for the future coupon distribution, it is important to note that sending the coupon to those who go to the Coffee House more often and when the weather is above 60 degrees will result in a higher acceptance rate.
